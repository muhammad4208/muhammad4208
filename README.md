## Some helpful resources

- üíª [Tryhackme](https://tryhackme.com/) is a great hands-on online platform by [Ashu Savani and Ben Spring](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/springben). When examining TryHackMe's stellar reputation within the cyber security sector on multiple platforms, it's clear that it is extraordinarily well suited to newbies.
- üêç [Effective Python](https://www.amazon.com/Effective-Python-Specific-Software-Development/dp/0134853989/ref=sr_1_3?dchild=1&keywords=effective+python&qid=1596076710&s=books&sr=1-3) by [Brett Slatkin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/bslatkin/) is a great book full of advice that will help anyone write better Python code.  The book contains a bunch of self-contained lessons that shine a light into the language strengths and expressiveness.  It is truly excellent!
- ü¶à [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) by [Steven Van Acker](https://se.linkedin.com/in/stevenvanacker) Through engaging games, the OverTheWire community can assist you in learning and applying security ideas. They provide a variety of wargames to improve your skills.
- :alarm_clock: [Cracking the Coding Interview](https://www.amazon.com/Cracking-Coding-Interview-Programming-Questions/dp/0984782850/ref=sr_1_1?crid=2FD1OUTDC54F4&keywords=cracking+the+coding+interview&qid=1655494723&sprefix=crac%2Caps%2C919&sr=8-1). This book is pretty dense, but it's an excellent resource for preparing for a technical interview in any language.
